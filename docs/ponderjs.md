## Getting Started

Before we start, make sure [KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs) and [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) are installed.
All PonderJS scripts will be located inside the `client_scripts` folder. If you don't know where to find it, please take a look at the [KubeJS wiki](https://kubejs.com/).
